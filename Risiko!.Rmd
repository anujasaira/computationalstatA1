## Simulation problem: Risiko!
# Point a

First, consider the case where the attacker has two units, but the the defender has only one. Let X1, X2 be the random variables describing the outcome of the attacker’s tosses, and let Y1 be the defender’s result. Compute analytically the probability that the attacker has to win the battle at the first round (first toss). In other words, compute $P [\max(X_1, X_2) > Y_1]$.

$Z=max(X_1,X_2) \in (1,2,3,4,5,6)$

$P(Z=z)=(2(z-1)+1)/36$
